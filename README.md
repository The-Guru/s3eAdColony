===========

Marmalade EDK extension for using AdColony 2.0.1.32 in iOS devices.

In order to use this extension you have to be registered at http://adcolony.com/

Because the adColonyApplicationID and the ZoneIDs are embedded in the extension,
you will have to compile the extension with your own adColonyApplicationID and ZoneIDs.

You can find a .pdf file about how AdColony works at https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK
